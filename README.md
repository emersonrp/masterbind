<b>masterbind has been deprecated.</b>

The work on masterbind has been continued and greatly expanded in [bindcontrol](https://github.com/emersonrp/bindcontrol).  Please check it out.

<hr>

This is something between a clone and a port of CityBinder
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/citybinder/), using the Wx Widget UI toolkit
so that it's cross-platform, and using python because that's the way I roll.

Currently (2019) it does almost nothing -- it'll display the main window, and
some of the ui elements sort of work, but it won't save or load profiles,
generate bindfiles, or really anything useful.

The majority of the bind-generating logic from CityBinder has been implemented,
so remaining is the wiring together the middle bits between the UI and the
logic.


The intent is to make this available pre-rolled into standalone binaries for
Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

MasterBind is licensed under the GPL, version 2 or later.
